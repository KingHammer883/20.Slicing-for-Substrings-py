    "Some applications extract portions of strings called substrings. FOr example, an application that sorts filenames according to type might use the last three characters in a filename, called its 'extension', to determine the file's type(exceptions to this rule, such as the extensions '.py', and '.html', will be considered later in this chapter). \n",
    "\n",
    "On a Windows file system, a filename ending in '.txt' denotes a human-readable text file, whereas a filename ending in '.exe' denotes an executable file of machine code. You can use Python's subscript operator to obtain a substring through a process called 'slicing'. To extract a substring, the progreammer places a colon(:) in the subscript. An integer value can appear on either side of the colon. Here are some examples that show how slicing is used:\n",
